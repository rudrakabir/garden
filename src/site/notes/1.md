After the downfall of Apollo, the best reddit app there ever was(Apart from Alien Blue, the best reddit app there ever was - ([[Why reddit is (was?)my favourite social media\|Why reddit is (was?)my favourite social media]])), I started spending a lot of time on my phone on twitter instead, which led me to discover this guy @visakanv, who is a really great writer, and that's something that i really aspire to be. 


But what to/where to/how to has given me severe analysis paralysis, so while I figure that out on the side, I want to at least start the most difficult part of the process, actually writing. so the basic point is that everyone has good writing in them, they just have to get the bad writing(actually, extends to more than just writing), out of the way first. and that kinda makes sense? 

So I am writing these live, in my obsidian, without any editing, constant stream of thought kinda stuff. The aim is consistency first, and quality will come.
