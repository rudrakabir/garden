## Apps
Alien Blue is one of the best reddit apps there ever was

Apollo was its spirital succesor, until it was killed off by the whole API pricing _debacle_.

RES, or reddit enhancement suite is also a thing that makes reddit really awesome

basically reddit allows(or used to allow, some of this is me reminiscing about what reddit used to be, it's changing, like all things) you to extend your browsing experience on reddit, with apps like Apollo or RES, which i found really awesome
